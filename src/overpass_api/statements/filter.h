/* == The Query Filter ==

The query filter can be added as condition to a query statement.
It has an evaluator as argument
and it lets pass only those elements for which the expression returns boolean true.

At the moment, the query filter cannot be the only condition in a query.
This is due to implementation reasons and will change in future versions.

It is technically possible to have multiple query filters in a single query.
But it does not make sense:
Their evaulators can be combined with a conjunction in a single query filter.
This has the same semantics and is faster.

Its syntax is

  (if: <Evaluator>)

The whitespace is optional.
