# How to use this image

This image on startup initializes with data on first start.
To do it properly it needs a bit of guidance in form of enviroment variables.
* `OVERPASS_MODE` - takes the value of either `init` or `clone`
* `OVERPASS_META` - `yes`, `no` or `attic` - passed to Overpass as `--meta` or `--keep-attic`
* `OVERPASS_DIFF_URL` - url to diff's directory for updating the instance (eg. https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/minute/)
* `OVERPASS_PLANET_URL` - url to "planet" file in `init` mode
* `OVERPASS_PLANET_SEQUENCE_ID` - sequence identifier corresponding to planet file above. All files after this one will be applied
* `OVERPASS_COMPRESSION` - takes values of `no`, `gz` or `lz4`. Specifies compression mode of the Overpass database. 
Ony useful in `init` mode. Defaults to `gz`
* `OVERPASS_RULES_LOAD` - desired load generated by areas generation. Controls how long the script will sleep before regenerating
areas. Set it to 1, and script will sleep 99x times longer than it works, set it to 50 - and script will sleep as long as last
execution, set it to 100, and script will sleep 3 seconds between each execution.


Image works in two modes `clone` or `init`. This affects how the instance gets initialized. If the mode is set to `clone`
then data is copied from http://dev.overpass-api.de/api_drolbr/ and then updated from diffs. This will result in Overpass instance
covering whole world. This mode works only with minute diffs.

In `init` mode you need to point `OVERPASS_PLANET_URL` to address with planet (partial) dump. This file will be downloaded,
indexed by Overpass and later - updated using `OVERPASS_PLANET_SEQUENCE_ID` and `OVERPASS_DIFF_URL`. You need to check which
sequence number is for your planet file. Take it from desctiption or just take a sequence number a day before your planet
file is dated.

Start initalization mode with `-i` and `-t` options to `docker run` so you will have a chance to monitor the progress of
file downloads etc.

After initialization is finished Docker container will stop. Once you start it again (with `docker start` command) it will start
downloading minute diffs, applying them to database and serving API requests.

Container exposes port 80.

All data resides within /db directory in container.

# Examples
## Overpass instance covering part of the world
In this example Overpass instance will be initialized with planet file for Poland downloaded from Geofabrik. Data will be stored in folder
`/big/docker/overpass_db/` on the host machine. Overpass will be available on port 12345 on host machine.
```
docker run \
  -e OVERPASS_META=yes \
  -e OVERPASS_MODE=init \
  -e OVERPASS_PLANET_URL=http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/poland-latest.osm.bz2 \
  -e OVERPASS_DIFF_URL=http://download.openstreetmap.fr/replication/europe/poland/minute/ \
  -e OVERPASS_PLANET_SEQUENCE_ID=2346486 \
  -v /big/docker/overpass_db/:/db \
  -p 12345:80 \
  -i -t \
  --name overpass_poland overpass
```

## Overpass clone covering whole world
In this example Overpass instance will be initialized with data from main Overpass instance and updated with master planet diffs.
Data will be stored in /big/docker/overpass_clone_db/ directory on the host machine and API will be exposed on port 12346 on host machine.
```
docker run \
  -e OVERPASS_META=yes
  -e OVERPASS_MODE=clone
  -e OVERPASS_DIFF_URL=https://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/minute/
  -v /big/docker/overpass_clone_db/:/db
  -p 12346:80
  -i -t
  --name overpass_world
  overpass
```
